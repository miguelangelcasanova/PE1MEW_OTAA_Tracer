# PE1MEW OTAA Join Request Tracer V1.0
The PE1MEW OTAA Join Request Tracer V1.0 is a program to track LoRaWAN nodes that use OTAA for personalisation and that are incorrectly commissioned. As a result of this, the node will send periodically JoinRequest messages that are not answered with a Join Accept to finalise the personalisation process.

The PE1MEW OTAA Join Request Tracer V1.0 can be used with the same hardware as used for a single channel gateway that can be found on Github: https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0
